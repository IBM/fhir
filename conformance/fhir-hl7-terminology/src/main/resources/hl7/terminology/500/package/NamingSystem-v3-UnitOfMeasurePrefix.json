Implementations should use the code system UCUM with OID 2.16.840.1.113883.6.8\r\n\r\nNote that due to some tooling issues, some of the synonym codes that differed only in case (upper/lower) were not being assembled into MIF correctly, therefore they have been removed as a workaround for these tooling issues. This should have limited effect as this system has been deprecated for 8 years, and retired for 4 years, and will be removed soon.",
