    "description": "A Drug Identification Number (DIN) is a computer-generated eight digit number assigned by Health Canada to a drug product prior to being marketed in Canada. It uniquely identifies all drug products sold in a dosage form in Canada and is located on the label of prescription and over-the-counter drug products that have been evaluated and authorized for sale in Canada.  A DIN uniquely identifies the following product characteristics:\r\n\r\n *  manufacturer\r\n *  product name\r\n *  active ingredient(s)\r\n *  strength(s) of active ingredient(s)\r\n *  pharmaceutical form, and\r\n *  route of administration.\r\n\r\nNote: The number has a leading zero.\r\n\r\nFurther information about this Code System can be found at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/regulatory-requirements-drug-identification-numbers/document.html",
