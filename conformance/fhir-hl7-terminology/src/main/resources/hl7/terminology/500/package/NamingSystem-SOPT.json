It is a mechanism for consistent reporting of payer data to state health data organizations and supports data comparisons by payer type across states, various provider types, and to national benchmarks.  Developed by the Public Health Data Standards Consortium (PHDSC) Payer Typology Subcommittee, the typology includes broad hierarchial payer type categories with more specific subcategories. \r\n\r\nThe audience for Source of Payment Typology includes researchers, public health advocates, and healthcare analysts.",
