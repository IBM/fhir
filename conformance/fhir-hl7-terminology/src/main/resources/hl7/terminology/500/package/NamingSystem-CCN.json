    "description": "Per CMS Transmittal 29 dated OCTOBER 12, 2007:\r\n\r\n\"The National Provider Identifier (NPI) will replace the Medicare/Medicaid Provider Number on Medicare claims. The NPI will assume the Medicare/Medicaid Provider Number's role as a primary identifier. However, the Medicare/Medicaid Provider Number will continue to be issued to providers and used to verify Medicare/Medicaid certification on all survey and certification, and resident/patient assessment transactions. In order to avoid confusion with the NPI, the Medicare/Medicaid Provider Number (also known as the OSCAR Provider Number, Medicare Identification Number or Provider Number) has been renamed the CMS Certification Number (CCN). The CCN continues to serve a critical role in verifying that a provider has been Medicare certified and for what type of services.\"\r\n\r\nSee https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/transmittals/downloads/r29soma.pdf",
